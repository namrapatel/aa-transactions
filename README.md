# Account Abstraction transactions testsite
This site will wrap a user's desired transaction in intuitive `UserOperations` and will make JSON RPC calls that send `UserOperations` created by the user to the [Nethermind account abstraction client implementation](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/tree/account-abstraction/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.AccountAbstraction), which will then call the [Singleton contract](https://github.com/opengsn/account-abstraction/tree/main/contracts) to call the desired smart contract walletâ€”given that the intermediate conditions were met in accordance to the [Account Abstraction spec](https://hackmd.io/I5QJwZwkQKubm7HuiTBIug?view).
